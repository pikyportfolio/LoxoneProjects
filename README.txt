Loxone Config Version Selector

In technical support we tend to use quite a few different version of config, and it is super inconvenient to open the file, see that it is the wrong version close
and try the next one. 

Current implementation: 

1.Run the program:
2.Put the Loxone folder path in.
3.Select your desired version
4.Enjoy

Added:

-sorting
-caching previously browsed location
-error handling



Miniserver DefLog Pharser

As DefLogs tend to be very long and hard to read, we search for the lines with relevant information and create a smaller file

To add:
Drag and drop or browse GUI

Information in the first line about how many Errors were found

Date selection, so it only prints information within a certain range

Document reference to solutions *Maybe*
