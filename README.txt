Loxone Config Version Selector

In technical support we tend to use quite a few different version of config, and it is super inconvenient to open the file, see that it is the wrong version close
and try the next one. 

Current implementation: 

1.Run the program:
2.Put the Loxone folder path in.
3.Select your desired version
4.Enjoy



Features to be added:
User Interface
Executable
Language Selector
Error and runtime optmisation
